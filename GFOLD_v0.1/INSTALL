Please try out building GFOLD++ using cmake. You need to install cmake, I'm using the latest binary (2.6.2) from www.cmake.org .
Older versions seem to have problems finding the boost libraries.

Quick install
----------------------

Compile GFOLD++ library and example programs:

cmake .
make


If that does not work, please continue reading.

Additional information
-----------------------


If there are problems finding libraries, e.g. boost, you can try to work around this
by setting environment variables. If you have boost under a non-standard prefix, you can 
add the prefix to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, e.g.:
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/net/

If you instead have boost installed as a separate package, you can set the
environment variable BOOST_ROOT, e.g.:
export BOOST_ROOT=/opt/boost-1_37/
cmake then tries to find required headers and libraries in $BOOST_ROOT/include
and $BOOST_ROOT/lib .

---
PLEASE NOTE: It is important that the boost libraries are compiled using the same compiler as you are using for GFOLD++. The filenames of the boost libraries contains the compiler name and compiler version that they were built with.
---


In cmake you compile in a separate directory from the source directory. This
keeps the source directory uncluttered. If you have GFOLD in e.g.
~/src/GFOLD and decide to compile in
~/tmp/GFOLD-build, you do the following:

mkdir ~/tmp/GFOLD-build
cd ~/tmp/GFOLD-build
cmake ~/src/GFOLD # this command creates Makefiles
make

You can change default settings using either cmake (command line), ccmake (text
user interface) or cmake-gui (duh). With 
cmake -LH .
you can list possible basic options. For all options, use
cmake -LAH .
For example, in order to generate verbose Makefiles so that all compiler
commands are visible, and with a different c++ compiler, issue:
cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/usr/local/bin/c++ .
